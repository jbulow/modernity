Exploring maru-2.1

Starting points:
- emit.l
- eval.l

- Makefile


TODOs: Figure out what's allowed in the maru s-expr language and
provided by the boot.l env

# Maru s-expr language:

Number literals:
    4

String literals:
    "Hello"

# What do I want

* a system that never sleeps
* a concise (maybe even mathematical) description of the system
* graphics... and all that entails
* works with the outside world
* inherently collaborative
* inherently didactic


# Sharing
* Via books
* Imported and managed in a local library
